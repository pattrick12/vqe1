# This repository is for the IQC project, which benchmarks the convergence speeds and energy values of VQE ans√§tze.
Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are widely used in quantum chemistry to determine the ground state energy of molecular systems. The efficiency of a VQE heavily depends on the ansatz and the optimizer used. In this project done in team of 2 with [@somay-jalan](https://github.com/somay-jalan), we aim to optimize the ansatz for given molecules to accurately compute their ground state energy. This problem lies at the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning, making it an exciting field of research. Our focus is on comparing different optimization techniques to evaluate their effectiveness in training quantum circuits for molecular simulations.
